-->"Asynchronous Javascript":Asynchronous Javascript means some functions/actions which takes some time to execute.
it will execute certain parts of the code asynchronously. 
   -->Better performance
   -->Improves responsiveness
   -->simplify the code

-->we can perform Asynchronous actions in JS using 3 ways:
   i.callbacks:callbacks are the functions which are given in another function parameters.
      To use callbacks for Asynchronous JS, we can use Timers.
      a..setTimeOut(callback,time in ms):This function will execute its callback after the time is over.
         ->eg:setTimeOut(function()
         {
            console.log("hello world")
         },1000)
      b. setInterval(callback,time in ms):This function will execute its callback for every time of given time is over.
         eg:setInterval(function()
         {
            console.log("hello world")
         },1000)

-->To stop setTimeout or setInterval, we have timeStoppers i.e clearTimeout and clearInterval:
   ->clearTimeout:it is used to remove/clear the traces of setTimeout using its object value.
   ->clearInterval:it is used to remove/clear the traces of setInterval using its object value.

   ii.Promises
   iii.async await
